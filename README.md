Roller Coaster Lab
------

This code was used for designing a roller coaster track for my dynamics class.

More In-Depth
------

The roller coaster had many design restraints, such as max G-forces the riders would experience in each direction, height of the track, max length of the track, and a realistic braking section.

This code:
* Defines equations that define the track in 3-dimensional space
* Calculates the speed at any given point on the track
* Calculates the G-forces experienced by a rider in the normal, lateral, and tangential directions
* Calculates the bank of 2 "perfectly banked" turns
* Plots all of this information
